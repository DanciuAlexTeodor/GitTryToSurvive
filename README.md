## ⚒️ Medieval Crafting & Realistic Processes

Crafting powerful items like swords, shields, or armor isn’t instant — it requires time, effort, and realism.  
Unlike most modern games, *Try To Survive* emphasizes detailed medieval processes. For example, iron must first be **mined**, then **melted in a furnace**, and finally **forged into shape using a hammer**.  
Other actions include **cooking, skinning, polishing**, and more — each with its own realistic sequence.
